Documentation for the SnapMD Virtual Care API

Documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and is accessible via our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/SnapMD/virtualcare-api-docs/wiki) or by downloading the repository.

API call reference for the REST API can be found at [https://sandbox.connectedcare.md/api/Help/](https://sandbox.connectedcare.md/api/Help/).

## The Wiki submodule

The Wiki can be accessed via the GitHub UI, but it can also be managed locally as a collection of Markdown files. For quick access it has been added as a submodule. To check out the documentation repository, run

    $ git clone https://github.com/SnapMD/virtualcare-api-docs.git

load the submodule, run

    $ cd virtualcare-api-docs.git
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

This will load the wiki locally.

Alternatively, the wiki can be loaded directly if you don't need access to the example code.

    $ git clone https://github.com/SnapMD/virtualcare-api-docs.wiki.git
